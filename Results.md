The purpose of this script was to analyze whether there was any relationship between income and whether or not counties switched the party they voted for over time. My initial hypothesis was that wealthy voters were trending towards the democrat party, and I wanted to see if this was a significant enough trend that it could be seen on the county level.  This analysis was supplemented with six visuals, including four maps that show which counties switched party each election, one map showing swing counties, and one map showing the frequency of counties voting democrat or republican.

The actual analysis was conducted in two main ways.  The first way was by tracking the relationship between income and voting over five separate elections.  The results were visualized with a series of violin plots with showed how income corresponded to voting.  The results for the entire nation showed that both parties received the bulk of their votes from lower to lower middle income people; democrats have some slightly higher income voters and also some slightly lower income voters while republican votes are clustered in between.  This distribution was remarkably constant across all five elections with no sign at all of actually wealthier voters trending democrat or poorer voters trending Republican.

The second level of the analysis was to divide the US into two categories: "swing counties," which voted for one party three times and the other party two times, and "stable counties," which voted for the same party at least four of five times.  The goal here was to see if counties that switched who they voted for had any different income characteristics than the stable counties.

The same violin plots were re-ran on swing counties and stable counties to see if there was any difference.  The swing counties did seem to show a slight shift of income rising for swing counties which voted democrat across the five elections and income lowering for swing counties which voted republican.  However, the gap was not very large and the bulk of counties that voted for either party still hovered around lower to lower middle class.  There was not significant evidence that wealthy voters were driving a significant trend of flipping counties towards democrats.

The top per capita income for counties in the swing county series was only $120,000, significantly lower than the top per capita income for the entire country ($200,000).  Meanwhile the distribution of voting for the stable counties was significantly more similar to the violin plots for the entire country and shared the same top per capita income.

Because the stable county series had such a higher maximum income and otherwise resembled the national distribution, I developed a secondary theory that maybe counties which were wealthier were happier with the status quo, while counties with less income growth, or more unstable income growth, were more likely to want to switch sides.  To analyze this I constructed a line plot that displayed income growth for both swing counties and stable counties.  The lines of income growth were almost perfectly touching each other all the way from 2000 to 2016, suggesting there was no difference in average income or income growth between swing counties and stable counties.  The fact that the top per capita income was significantly higher for stable counties suggests there were also significantly more poor counties in the stable counties series, enough that on a broad enough scale the wealthier and poorer counties averaged out to have the same income as the swing counties.

In conclusion, there was modest evidence that slightly wealthier swing counties are trending democrat and slightly poorer swing counties are trending republican.  However this is only in relative terms, the bulk of all swing counties are lower to lower middle class and there is no evidence that wealthy counties are driving a shift towards republicans.  There is furthermore no evidence that average incomes or income growth is any different in swing counties when compared to stable counties.

I would caution against over-interpreting these findings.  The fact that incomes are the same in swing and stable counties does not mean that economic issues do not matter to these voters, or that they do not have legitimately distinct opinions on economic issues that cannot be gleaned from this data.  It just means that there is no evidence that the underlying economic conditions are any different in swing counties when compared to stable counties, or the country as a whole.

Furthermore, counties might be too large of a geographic area to conduct this analysis as best as it could possibly be done.  Counties can take in both rich suburbs together with struggling cities and produce a totally unremarkable, average income.  More precise data, on the level of census tracts or voting precincts, might show a sharper, more accurate picture of the extent to which income drives voting.  My next step is to try to do just that and reproduce this analysis on a more granular dataset.
